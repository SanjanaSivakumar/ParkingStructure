//The purpose of this class is to set the definition for when a Bus object will be created.
//This class is set up in such a way that aids in the functionality of the parking structure.
//This class is one of the derived classes of the Vehicle class
#include "Bus.h"

}
//This is the Bus class's destructor, there are no parameters, this function executes when an object goes out of scope
Bus::~Bus() {
	cout << "Bus destroyed" << endl;
}
//This function does not take in any parameters and returns an int with the size of a Bus object, which is 3.
//This method helps with checking a vehicle's size before allowing it to park

}
//This function does not take in any parameters and returns the string, "B". This function helps
//with the ParkingStructure class's toString method, which is called when the user chooses to print out
//the ParkingStructure

//This function does not take in any parameters and returns an int, whose value is the position at which
//the Bus is parked, this helps a lot with the removal of a vehicle from a ParkingSpot

//This function returns void, and takes in an int as a parameter. The parameter is the value of the position
//that the user wishes to park their car. This function helps with the parking of a vehicle from a ParkingSpot
